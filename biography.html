            <h2><span>// Where It All Began</span></h2>
            <p>My journey into design started with Myspace. It was 2005, Freshman year at college
              and I was sitting in front of a computer in the library staring at a blank page of a
              profile that I had just created earlier. My friends were all on this site and I wanted
              in on the action, but comparing a blank page to theirs' - full of color, littered with
              animations and pictures alongside various font-styles was nothing short of awesome.
              Luckily, my roommate was familiar with this social platform and knew how to design
              personal pages, so he helped me with mine. This was where I dabbled with my first lines
              of <font color="#00FF00">code</font> and entered the world of digital
              <font color="#FFFF00">design</font>.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've been drawn to designs of various backgrounds - from the beautiful
              architectural structures in Dubai (haven't been, but one day I'll make it there to
              see them in person), to the intricate wrapping of a Christmas gift that I'd be
              hesitant to rip into simply because I wouldn't want to ruin the beauty of it, down to the simple
              packaging of a brand new iPhone.</p>
            <h2><span>// Call to Action</span></h2>
            <p>Having worked most of my professional life in Corporate America meant spending a lot
              of time in business meetings, putting out fires, and lots of coffee. During my time here
              I couldn't help but notice how a number of people still struggled with technology -
              navigating a website or operating a mobile application became a common frustration among
              some of my colleagues.</p>
            <p>I was often approached for assistance; whether it was designing and creating spreadsheets
              with formulas already prewritten into the worksheet to allow a better workflow when tracking
              data, to crafting eye catching emails with images and color for the sales team - I was
              helping people and it was a very humbling experience. I wanted more of it.</p>
            <p>It was during this point in my life that I picked up the call and decided to trade in my
              cubicle and hang-up the suit & tie in favor of a new change that would bring me satisfaction
              and joy for the remainder of my professional career.</p>
            <h2><span>// Chasing UX</span></h2>
            <p>I consider myself a business savvy individual. I know and understand the ethics of Corporate
              America. The goals and visions of a company as well as the values needed to be created for
              shareholders. I can comprehend a business's needs and speak the language. And as I continue to
              grow and develop my skills as a <b>UX Designer</b>, I'm looking to connect that skill-set with
              my business accumen so as to create intuitive solutions that not only addresses the customer's
              concerns, but would also fall inline with the company's organizational goals.</p>
