            <p>To date, there are several cloud storage platforms available to consumers, most
              of which try to cover a wide audience. What about a niche crowd of content creators?

              and collaboration?</p>

            <p>The cloud storage space has been around for several years and is an established

            new market entrant, I needed to first identify who were our competitors and
            understand the market. A SWOT Analysis was used to help initiate the process.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Google Drive has a strong presence in the market through its already existing
                userbase of other services. However, the features are basic and rather limited.</li>
              <li>MS One Drive has a very strong UI with a clean interface. However, features and
                services are targeting the enterprise and family spaces.</li>
              <li>DropBox has been around for quite some time, however most of their market targeting
                are more towards the enterprise and business sector.</li>

          <div class="logo-content-1">
            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>Given that this industry was already a heavily saturated market, I had to identify
              a point of entry to make a splash large enough for consumers to notice. In order to
              achieve this, the product's branding needed to evoke a sense of purpose that also
              resonated with the brand's services - something to stoke the interest of the
              community.</p>
            <p>Through the help of some mind-mapping techniques and several sketches of what the
              product should convey, ARCHETYPE stood out with the most potential of what the brand
              would stand for.</p>
            <p>The meaning behind ARCHETYPE is better expressed as the original pattern or model of
              which all things of the same type are a respresentation of the original source. It will
              stand for ideas that are attractive yet simple with a creative personality and can be
              accessible to any professional content creator.</p>

            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>For the logo portion, I knew I wanted it to represent something that was synonymous
              of what ARCHETYPE stood for.</p>
            <p>I set out to work pouring through numerous sketches of what a potential logo could be,
              but none seemed to have captured my attention. So rather than focusing on a mark, I
              redirected my focus on the name itself - a word that is hardly used or heard in an
              everyday conversation and is unique enough to evoke a sense of curiousity regarding
              the brand's character and personality.</p>

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>Three layers for the color palette were chosen, each representing a certain identity
              that would be expressed throughout the brand's overall look and character.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The primary color is turqouise which is meant to signify professionalism and
                creativity and is also a great compliment to the various shades of gray and white
                colors.</li>
              <li>Black illustrates the strength of the brand and can be seen in text, headings, and
                throughout the background.</li>
              <li>Vermillion red adds vibrance and determination, while mustard yellow brings with it
                a splash of clarity and energy.</li>

            <p>User testing was conducted in-person and also in tandem with the revision and iteration

              problems or issues with the prototype, alongside gathering additional user-based input that
              would provide invaluable insight into the site's experience and usability.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>The undertaking of this project was definitely a challenge, but it was also fun. During the
              entire process, I researched and questioned certain areas that pushed my mental boundaries in
              creation and ideation. And as I found out early on in the process, designing something from
              scratch is not easy. There is a lot of time and effort that goes into this phase before pencil
              meets paper in drawing out the 1st batch of sketches.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Ideas will always shift, designs will always revise and iterate upon themselves, there will
              always be room for additional testing on prototypes and no matter how many times a design is
              made final, there is almost always a certainty that there will be several other <i><em>finals</em></i>
              before a final design is truly agreed upon. Learning will always remain as a constant variable
              in UX Design and the value achieved from growth is priceless.</p>
